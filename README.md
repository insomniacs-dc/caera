A Discord bot built as a collaborative project from [our server](https://discord.gg/5hdqdVPHmP) members.

# setup

Python version newer than 3.8 and older than 3.11 must be installed. 
`poetry` is used as the dependency manager. 

## steps for setup

replace `python` with `py`, `python3.x` or `py -3.x` depending on your python installation

```sh
python -m pip install poetry
poetry install
# if poetry install gives errors use python -m poetry instead 

# to activate the shell
poetry shell

# to run the bot
python .
```
